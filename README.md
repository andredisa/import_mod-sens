# 📊 Excel Generator from CSV - Sensors & Modules

This PHP project generates an Excel file from three CSV files: sensors, modules, and an existing Excel file. The output is an updated, sorted Excel file ready for printing with headers, borders, and signature rows.
## 🚀 Main Features

- ✅ Upload CSV files for sensors and modules
- 🧠 Intelligent parsing:
  - Supports duplicate rows with the same Line/Sensor or Line/Module
  - If there are multiple rows with the same ID, **chooses the one with `Type-id ≠ NONE`**
  - If `Type-id = NONE`, includes the row but **without description**
- 🧹  Cleans descriptions (`cleanString()`)
- 🗂️ Sorts data by `Line` and `Sensor/Module`
- 📄 Cleans the "ALL-6" sheet of the Excel fil
- 📌 Inserts data with formatting and signature rows
- 🎨 Simple and responsive HTML interface for upload
- 📥 Download the updated Excel file
